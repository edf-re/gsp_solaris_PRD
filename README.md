# Solaris

## Change History
2021.07.26 - Initial release

## Overview:
### Push a button, get an optimized solar project  
The reason for Solaris' existance is to enable Project Developers and Originators to get the most competitive project configuration with the lowest possible LCOE in real time. The hope is that this leads to a competitive advantage such that EDF constructs an additional 150 MW project per year. This translates into ___$37.5M___ per year in value by assuming EDF realizes approximatley $75M NPV at CoD and assuming Solaris gets half credit for the project being built. 

## Objectives:
- Lead to an extra 150 MW solar project per year.
- Get an optimized solar project configuration in real-time.
- The optimization process will be accurate to within $0.50 of the full V&A proforma modeling.
- Improve transparency and coordination between development and SMEs 
- Level up less experienced developers by giving them a window into the drivers behind a bid price.
- Reduce SME workload.

## Success Metrics:
### Happiness
- Goal: For users (developers and originators) to feel like the platform is giving them a reliable answer, faster.
- Signals: A satisfaction rating from a survey.
- Metrics: Net Promoter Score, satisfaction, can you live without the product?

### Engagement
- Goal: Maximize the number of project configurations considered by a developer.
- Signals: Number of configurations generated for a project. 
- Metrics: Count of `analysis_ids`, average count per project, rate at which new projects are created. 

### Adoption 
- Goal: For all of development to use the platform for solar project development.
- Signals: Number of developers and originators within GSP activly using the platform on a daily basis.
- Metrics: Percent of Development and Origination as daily active users. 

### Retention
- Goal: For GSP development users to rely on the product for thier daily work.
- Signals: Number of repeat users within GSP Development.
- Metrics: Repeat users, daily users, amount of time between user sessions.

### Task Success
- Goal: For users to get an accurate predicted revenue stream. 
- Signals: The number of successful analyses performed on a project.
- Metrics: Analysis count, analyses per week per project.
